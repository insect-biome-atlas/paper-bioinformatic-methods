Chesters tree, with original outgroups removed and replaced
with an expanded set of outgroup taxa, including reps of all
Hexapoda classes and a much larger set of arthropod and
other metazoan outgroups, with emphasis on groups that are
likely to be encountered in Malaise trap and soil samples.

The files can be regenerated using scripts in this repo.
